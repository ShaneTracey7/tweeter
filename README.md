Visit my Twitter clone, Tweeter: 

Purpose:

This was made to expand and apply my Django and Angular knowledge. I researched and went through several tutorials online to gain a basic understanding before starting this project. As well as hone my styling skills with SCSS, as I tried to replicate Twitter's UI within the project. 

What it does:

The project boasts all of the core features that made Twitter (now X), a top social media platform:

Posting:
Users can post about whatever they like, ex. to show support for their favorite sports teams, publicly share their opinions, etc.

Post Interacting:
Users can comment, like, or retweet any posts they like in a way to communicate to others publicly.

Following:
Users can follow their friends and accounts they find interesting. Posts from these accounts will populate their following feed.

Direct Messaging:
Users can communicate with others more privately, through direct messages.

Profile:
Users can view other's profiles and see their tweets, retweets, likes, etc.

Profile Customization:
Users can express themselves through how they customize their profile (profile picture, background picture, and written bio).


Tools:

-VS Code for programming the front-end and back-end

-Git for version control

- Google Draw for creating custom icons/logos

-iconmonstr for most of the icons: https://iconmonstr.com

-ran front-end and back-end from my laptop's terminal during development(front-end moved to GitHubPages and back-end being hosted elsewhere)
